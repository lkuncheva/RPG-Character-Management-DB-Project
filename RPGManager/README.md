﻿## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code
- SSMS 21.5.14
- Database Server: You need access to a database instance.
	Default: The project is configured to use SQL Server LocalDB ((localdb)\mssqllocaldb).
	Alternative: Any compatible SQL Server instance will work.
- EF Core Tools (CLI): Install the global tools for managing migrations:
	dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd RPGManager
   ```

2. **Edit appsettings.json and update the connection string:**
   For SQL Server LocalDB (default):
   ```
   {
   "ConnectionStrings": {
   "RpgDbContext": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=DbProjectRpg;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveRes
   }
   }
   ```

   For SQL Server:
   ```
   {
   "ConnectionStrings": {
   "RpgDbContext": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=DbProjectRpg;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveR
   }
   }
   ```

   For SQL Server with username/password:
   ```
   {
   "ConnectionStrings": {
   "RpgDbContext": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=DbProjectRpg;User Id=YOUR_USERNAME;Password=Y
   }
   }
   ```

3. **Restore NuGet packages**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

5. **Create database and apply migrations**
   - Option A: Using the Dotnet CLI (Command Line Interface):
   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
   - Option B: Using the Package Manager Console
   (Use this if you are working within Visual Studio. Open the Package Manager Console window (Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console)):
   ```
   PM> Add-Migration InitialCreate
   PM> Update-Database
   ```

6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
